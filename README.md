### 🚀 Java & DSA Learning Journey  

Welcome to Kalem's Code Place ** Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey!  
This repository is my **public learning log** — where I document everything I’m learning daily, from the **basics of Java programming** to mastering ** DSA **.  

My goal is to prepare for interviews, and also to **build a strong logical mindset** so I can build solid programming fundamentals.

## 🎯 Goals  

- Build a strong foundation in **Core Java**.  
- Learn and master **Data Structures & Algorithms** step by step.  
- Improve **problem-solving** and **logical thinking**.  
- Prepare for **TOP MNCS & tech interviews**.  
- Share my journey publicly to **help and collaborate** with others.
